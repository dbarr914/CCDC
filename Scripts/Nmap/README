When scanning a subnet for auditing purposes run the following:

nmap -A -v -oX "$(date +%T)_nmap_scan.xml" <IP Address/CIDR>

To transform the xml output of the previous command into an html document, run the following:

xsltproc path/to/nmap.xsl path/to/nmapscan.xml > nmapscan.html


If xsltproc is not installed, run the following:

Debian:   sudo apt-get install -y xsltproc
CentOS:  sudo yum install xsltproc    ****May need to change this. Not sure if correct.
